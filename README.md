# VR-Rubix-Cube
A VR Rubix cube game made using Unity 3D

### System requirements: 

PC with VR support (Windows PC with GTX 1060 preferred) 

An Oculus Rift S VR headset 

### Project Description

Rubik’s Cube is a widely popular mechanical puzzle that has attracted attention around the world because of its unique characteristics. As a classic brain-training toy well known to the public, Rubik’s Cube was used for scientific research and technology development by many scholars. In this project, a 3x3 Rubik’s puzzle cube is developed in Unity3D virtual reality having each side controlled via the Oculus Rift controllers. The aim of this game is to rotate the sides of the Rubik's cube in order for each side to have matching color. 


### Gameplay:

a.	Goal:

•	Match all the colors of each side of the Rubik’s cube

b.	User Skills:

•	innovate or combine any rotational algorithms he or she can think of to solve the cube.

c.	Game Strategy:

•	The game will allow the user to freely rotate the cube. The Rubik’s cube will have 26 inner cubelets and each cube will have colored planes. Each side of the Rubik's cube will have 6 sides and each side will have 9 cubelets with colored planes. Each of these includes a concealed inward extension that interlocks with the other cubes while permitting them to move to different locations. these provide structure for the other pieces to fit into and rotate around.

d.     Losing:

•	If a timer constraint is selected by the player. Then if the timer runs out before solving the Rubik’s cube, the player loses

### User Interface 

1.	Main Menu:
Rubik’s Cube game will have multiple user interface functions. The game will first display the main menu which consists of 3 different options, “Start New Game”, “Resume Game” and “Exit Game”. 
2.	Shuffle:
Upon Starting the game, the user will be provided with a “Shuffle” button in the virtual space that scrambles the cube using a randomized algorithm and puts the state of the cube far from being completed as much as possible.(not possible manually?) If they can rearrange it, then they can shuffle it!
3.	Timer:
The virtual space will contain a timer that starts once the player has interacted with the scrambled cube and stops when the player has aligned all 6 sides of the cube with its corresponding color.
Timer:
i.	Time left / time spent: variable
ii.	Position: static
iii.	Color: static
iv.	Name: static

4.	 Menu:
The player also has a “gear” icon placed in the virtual space. Once it is clicked will display 3 options, “Restart”, “High Scores”, and “Exit”. It also acts as a pause button in case the player needs to take a break.
5.	Hints:
Finally, the player has a “Hints” option displayed in the virtual space that would view a list of algorithms to get a cubelet from one side to the other.
